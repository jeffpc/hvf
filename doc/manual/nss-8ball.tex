\label{chap:8ball}
The 8ball NSS is a trivial guest intended for basic guest capabilities
testing and user amusement.

After IPL, 8ball attempts to find device number \mbox{0009} assuming it is a
3215 console.  Failure to detect the device is indicated by entering a
disabled wait state with the instruction address equal to 20000 hex.

If the console was found, the program proceeds to greet the user, prompting
him to enter a question.  Once the user enters any data, a randomly selected
response is printed to the terminal and another question is requested.

\section{Error conditions}
All error conditions are indicated by loading disabled wait state with
various instruction addresses.

\item[0000F1] Failed to initiate I/O (SSCH set non-zero condition code), or

	code to 3).
\item[0000F2] Failed to obtain a functional clock (STCK set condition code to
