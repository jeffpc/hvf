This release took far too long to make. But it was worth it. Beside assorted
bug-fixes, and other cleanups a decent amount of work went toward having the
CP communicate with the user. Hopefully, with the current code, it won't be
too hard to implement a rudimentary command reading and parsing.

The highlight of this release is the fact that it worked on a z10 without
any modifications.

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.
