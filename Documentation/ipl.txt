This file attempts to describe what happens during IPL.

NOTE: At the time, only IPL from tape is supported.

1) system reads 24 bytes from the device

   a) bytes   0-7: new PSW, no interrupts, start address 0x800000 (8MB)

   b) bytes  8-15: CCW to rewind the tape to previous TM

   c) bytes 16-23: CCW to read the entire loader to 0x800000 (8 MB)

2) arch mode is changed to z/Arch (see ipl/setmode.S)

3) temporary stack is set up (R15 being the pointer) (see ipl/setmode.S)

4) loader begins to execute: function load_nucleus (see ipl/loader.c)

   NOTE: loader.c use static inlines extensively, and thefore stack usage is
   minimal

   a) nucleus is read from tape to 0x400000 (4 MB)

      NOTE: the data at 4MB just read is an 64-bit s390 ELF binary with
      Linux ABI bits

      i)   addition CCW address is set in the ORB

      ii)  __readnucleus() is called; this function is implemented in
           assembly (see ipl/loader_asm.S)

      iii) IO interrupt handler is set up (implemented in asm, see
           ipl/loader_asm.S)

      iv)  ORB is sent to the subchannel

      v)   interrupts are enabled

      vi)  a new PSW with wait state bit set is loaded

      vii) on IO interrupt

           1) TSCH is issued to fill in a IRB

           2) magic value (ORB int param) is checked

	   3) Device End flag is checked in the IRB

	      NOTE: more checks should be performed here

	   4) If the device end flag is set, return to code that set up the
              interrupt handler

	   5) otherwise, load up the old IO PSW (the one with the wait
              state)

      viii)return to caller (back to ipl/loader.c)

   b) verify ELF header magic number, machine, type, etc. values

   c) traverse the section headers & copy data to final destination

      i)   if the section type is PROGBITS (data stored in the ELF), copy
           the data from it's temporary location to the desired location
	   (destination, offset within file, and length are all stored in
	   the section header) - this takes care of .text, .data, and
	   .rodata sections

      ii)  if the section type is NOBITS (uninitialized storage, e.g.,
           .bss), do nothing, just assume that the location is a valid
	   location in memory

      iii) skip any other section types

      NOTE: SYMTAB and STRTAB section types should be copied to a useful
      location to allow for symbols to be looked up during nucleus execution

   d) jump to the entry point as indicated by the ELF header

At this point, the nucleus is executing.
