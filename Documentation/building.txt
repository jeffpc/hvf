Required software:
==================

	gcc
	binutils

I (Josef 'Jeff' Sipek) develop on Linux running under Hercules, if you have
such a setup, running "make" in the top level directory should be enough to
have the entire system compiled and linked. This will create 2 files:

	hvf		- the nucleus
	loader.bin	- the IPLable code which properly starts up the
			  nucleus

If you do not have a zLinux environment setup, it is possible to cross
compile HVF, however the current build system does not support that.
Patches welcomed :)


Testing:
========

The `hercules' directory contains sample .cnf and .tdf files to IPL HVF in
Hercules.

(1) change into the `hercules' directory
(2) start hercules with the config file (hercules -f hvf.cnf)
(3) telnet to port 3271 (this is the 3215 console)
(4) IPL from device 580
